## Process

The app was created in NodeJS. React and Tailwind CSS were used to create an efficient UI, while JS was used to create the server. The server handles requests from the UI and is responsible for retrieving weather data and formatting it. The Weather data is pulled by OpenWeatherMap, which provides a variety of details. Overall, this app was really fun to make as well as providing another learning opportunity.
